# How to Contribute

If you want to add a new feature please [open an issue](https://github.com/pyrra-dev/pyrra/issues/new) first.

## Git Workflow

A good example on how to setup your repository for development can be found on the
[Kubernetes Github Workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md) page.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have a recent version of:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.16+)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install)

In order to build the UI you'll also need:

```
$ npm install react-scripts
```

## Building

Please check out the [Makefile](Makefile) on which targets are available to test
and build the project.
